# Task Management Application

A web-based task management application built using the Node.js and React stack.

## Project Description

The Task Management Application allows users to create, update, and organize their tasks. It provides features such as user authentication, task CRUD operations, filtering and sorting tasks, real-time updates, notifications, a user-friendly interface, a backend API, data persistence, testing and validation, and deployment.

## Key Features

- User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization using Node.js and a library like Passport.js or JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Task CRUD Operations: Allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Users can set task priorities, due dates, and assign tasks to specific categories or projects.
- Task Filtering and Sorting: Implement filtering and sorting options to help users organize and prioritize their tasks based on different criteria.
- Real-time Updates: Use WebSockets or a library like Socket.IO to provide real-time updates to users when changes are made to their tasks or when new tasks are assigned.
- Notifications: Implement a notification system to alert users about upcoming task deadlines or task assignments.
- User Interface: Design a user-friendly and responsive interface using React and popular UI libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for task organization.
- Backend API: Create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle client-server communication for task management operations.
- Data Persistence: Use a database such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user data, including tasks, categories, and user information.
- Testing and Validation: Write unit tests using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha to ensure functionality and reliability. Implement form validation to enforce data integrity.
- Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS for online accessibility.

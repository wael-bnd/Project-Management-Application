# Project Management Application

A web-based project management application built using the Node.js and React stack.

## Project Description

The Project Management Application allows users to create, update, and organize their projects. It provides features such as user authentication, project CRUD operations, task management within projects, team collaboration, progress tracking, timelines, notifications, a user-friendly interface, a backend API, data persistence, testing and validation, and deployment.

## Key Features

- User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization using Node.js and a library like Passport.js or JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Project CRUD Operations: Allow users to create, read, update, and delete projects. Users can set project deadlines, assign team members, track progress, and manage project resources.
- Task Management Within Projects: Provide the ability to create, update, and assign tasks within projects. Users can set task priorities, due dates, and monitor task status and completion.
- Team Collaboration: Enable team members to collaborate on projects by assigning tasks, sharing project-related files and documents, and communicating through project-specific channels.
- Progress Tracking: Implement progress tracking and visualization features to help users monitor the status and progress of their projects and tasks.
- Timelines: Provide visual timelines or Gantt charts to display project schedules, milestones, and dependencies.
- Notifications: Implement a notification system to alert users about project updates, task assignments, approaching deadlines, and mentions within project discussions.
- User Interface: Design a user-friendly and responsive interface using React and popular UI libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design. Implement intuitive project management workflows and navigation.
- Backend API: Create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle client-server communication for project management operations.
- Data Persistence: Use a database such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user data, including projects, tasks, user information, and project-related documents.
- Testing and Validation: Write unit tests using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha to ensure functionality and reliability. Implement form validation to enforce data integrity.
- Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS for online accessibility.

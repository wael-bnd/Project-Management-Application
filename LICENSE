The MIT License does not explicitly grant or confirm ownership of the project. Instead, it grants permissions and provides terms for the usage, modification, distribution, and sublicensing of the software.

The MIT License states that anyone who obtains a copy of the software has the permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the software. It also requires that the original copyright notice and permission notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

While the MIT License does not address ownership explicitly, it does grant broad permissions to users and promotes open collaboration and sharing of the software. It is important to note that ownership of the project is generally determined by factors such as intellectual property laws, project contributors, and other legal agreements.

If you want to assert and protect your ownership rights over the project, you may consider consulting with a legal professional to ensure that you have the appropriate legal documents, such as copyright registration or contributor license agreements, in place.
